# FirstAidKit

In routine life if someone will get injured then first thought come in mind is doctor, So as part of machine learning ML kit is providing image processing so using that image processing we can give suggestion to injured people that this is First aid Suggestion.

Using this project people can find their First Aid Suggestion by asking them what are the symptoms, how he is feeling and etc.
So by user's body part , symptoms and photo's of injured part we can give them suggestion which you can apply.

We can add this feature to Google Lens and for development of this project I will going to use android studio and will use ML kit and will register few models and we can give suggestion on basis of it.
